						This is a multi-line comment in C 
			
			Here we are declaring some variables
			int age = 47; // This is an integer
			float pi = 3.14; // This is a float
			char hastag = '#'; // This is a character
			type of variables age and pi are int and float respectively
			in the variable hastag we are storing a character
			so basically we stored 47 in as an integer in age
			we stored 3.14 as a float in pi
			and we stored '#' as a character in hastag
			we can also store a string in a variable
			we will learn about strings later
			see the program below.
