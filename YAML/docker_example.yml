# Leave the Above Section it was just for demonstartion.
# In YAML we can write comment. but there a small twist
# That we cannot write comments with multiple lines.
# We can use #-hash to write the comment but every time we need to write it before 
# Commenting it.

# Above I have explained about comment in YAML.

# lets get started with YAML learning.

YAML :
  - YAML Ain't Markup Language
  - YAML is case sensetive 
  - > Here, yml, YML and Yml all are different and can be considered as a diffrent 
    and has different meaning for the interpreter.
#  - We can map the data using Colons :


---

yml : yaml
Description : > YAML and YML (yml and yaml) 
  both are correct, extention for both can be considered.
  we can save any configuration while containing the data of the instances 
  that you are running can be saved with .yml and .yaml.
threeDashes :
  - --- this threeDashes works like a separator.
threeDots :
  - ... This threeDots works like end of the file
Comments :
  - # this symbol is used for commenting.
  - - this dash is used for listing the objects.
mapping_of_Sequence :
  - mapping of a sequence can be done with the help of [ this bracket ].
mapping_of_mapping ::
  - mapping of mapping can be done with the help of { curly brackets }.

threeDashes :
  - we use threeDashes to Devide the section.
  - If we need to work with multipe containers within the same data
  - we can use this threeDashed to separe it.
  - just like this section i have separated individually.
