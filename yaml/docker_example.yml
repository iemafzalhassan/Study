# Leave the Above Section it was just for demonstartion.
# In YAML we can write comment. but there a small twist
# That we cannot write comments with multiple lines.
# We can use #-hash to write the comment but every time we need to write it before 
# Commenting it.

# Above I have explained about comment in YAML.

# lets get started with YAML learning.

YAML :
  - YAML Ain't Markup Language
  - YAML is case sensetive 
  - > Here, yml, YML and Yml all are different and can be considered as a diffrent 
    and has different meaning for the interpreter.
#  - We can map the data using Colons :


---

yml : yaml
Description : > YAML and YML (yml and yaml) 
  both are correct, extention for both can be considered.
  we can save any configuration while containing the data of the instances 
  that you are running can be saved with .yml and .yaml.
threeDashes :
  - --- this threeDashes works like a separator.
threeDots :
  - ... This threeDots works like end of the file
Comments :
  - # this symbol is used for commenting.
  - - this dash is used for listing the objects.
mapping_of_Sequence :
  - mapping of a sequence can be done with the help of [ this bracket ].
mapping_of_mapping ::
  - mapping of mapping can be done with the help of { curly brackets }.

# this a example for a user details in yml
time : 03 : 37 : 00 PM 
Date : 05 : 10 : 2023
player : iemafzalhassan
action : code a game of 2048 

# this is a dedication section for a user that is iemafzalhassan logs in the same directives.

---
threeDashes :
  - we use threeDashes to Devide the section.
  - If we need to work with multipe containers within the same data
  - we can use this threeDashed to separe it.
  - just like this section i have separated individually.

# lists

students:
  - marks
  - name
  - roll_No
  # like this also lists can be written
cities: [new delhi, muzaffarpur, patna, saharsa]


# some keys of the sequence will be empty
sparse seq :
  - hey
  - Null
  - how
  - sup
  - 
  - 


    # nested mapping :


name: iemafzalhassan
role:
  - rollNo: 38
  - age: 22
  - job: students



# same as above can be written inn another manner:


name: iemafzalhassan
role: { rollNo: 38 age: 22, job: students}
