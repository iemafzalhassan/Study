# Indentation

# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

# num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
# num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
# if num1 > num2:
#     print("num1 is greater than num2!")
# elif num1 == num2:
#     print("num1 is equal to num2!")
# else:
#     print("Follow indentation rules in python! as i followed to print this statement.")

# Python CLI (Command Line Interface)
# Python CLI is a way to execute Python commands directly. It is also known as Python Interactive Shell.
# Type "python3" in the terminal to open python CLI.

# Variables

# Variables are containers for storing data values.
# num1 = 10
# name = "John"
# num2 = 20
# num1 is a variable containing value 10.( Num1 is a variable name and 10 is a value assigned to it.)

#  Data Types

# Integer
# number = 1

# String
# NoName = "iemafzalhassan"

# Float
# Decimal = 1.1

# Boolean
# isTrue = True

# print(type(isTrue))

# Concatination

# name = "iemafzalhassan"
# age = 20
# print("My name is " + name + " and my age is " + str(age))

#  We can print Expression in print function.

# print("My Age after 1 year will be ", age + 1)


# print wit separator

# print("My name is", "iemafzalhassan and my Age is", age, sep="-->")



# ASCII --> American Standard Code for Information Interchange
# Represents Characters as numeric codes.
# A-Z --> 65-90
# a-z --> 97-122
# 0-9 --> 48-57
# space --> 32
# special characters --> 0-31, 127-255
# ord() --> function to get ASCII value of a character.

# char = "^"
# print(ord(char)) # 94
# print(ord("$")) # 36
# print(ord("@")) # 64


# chr() --> function to get character from ASCII value.
# Ascii = 255
# print(chr(Ascii)) # Ã¿


# Taking Input

# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# is_Student = input("Are you a student? (yes/no): ")
# RegNo = int(input("Enter your Registration Number: "))
# print("Hello! " + name + " your age is " + str(age) + " and your Registration Number is " + str(RegNo) + ".")
# print(name, "is a college student.")


#        sum of user input numbers



# firstNumber = int(input("Enter first number: "))
# secondNumber = int (input("Enter second number: "))
# sum = firstNumber + secondNumber    # + is an Addition operator. 
# print("Sum of",firstNumber,"and",secondNumber,"is",sum)
# print("Sum is {}".format(sum))


# Arthmetic operators  --> + (Add), - (Substract), * (Multiply), / (Divide), % (Modulus --> Returns Remainders.), ** (Exponential), // (Floor Division  --> This returns nearest whole numbers.)

# print("Sum", 21 + 12)
# print("Substraction", 21 - 12)
# print("Multiplication", 21 * 12)
# print("Division", 21 / 12)
# print("Remainder", 8 % 6)
# print("Exponential", 21 ** 12)
# print("Floor Division", 21 // 12)


# Assignment Operatos --> =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=

#  To run this block of clock uncomment the code one by one and run one by one.
# n1 = 2
# n2 = 3
# # n2 += n1
# # n2 -= n1
# # n2 *= n1
# # n2 /= n1
# # n2 %= n1
# print(n2)



# Comparison Operators --> == (Equal), != (Not Equal), > (Greater than), < (Less than), >= (Greater than or equal to), <= (Less than or equal to)

# n1 = 2
# n2 = 3


# print(n1 == n2) # False
# print(n1 != n2) # True
# print(n1 > n2) # False
# print(n1 < n2) # True
# print(n1 >= n2) # False
# print(n1 <= n2) # True


#   Logical Operators.
# and, or, not

# and (Retuens true if both the statements are true.),
# or (Returns True if one of the statement is true.),
# not (Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true.)

# exp1 = 32 > 12 # True
# exp2 = 12 < 5 # False
# print("exp1 and exp2:", exp1 and exp2) # False
# print("exp1 or exp2:", exp1 or exp2) # True
# print("not exp1", not exp1) # False


#  Identity Operators.
# is, is not

# is (Returns True if both variables are same object.)
# is not (Returns True if both variables are not same object.)

# x = 2
# y = 2
# print("if x is y: ", x is y) # True
# print("if x is not y: ", x is not y) # False




# Membership Operators.



# in, not in

# in (Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object.)
# not in (Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object.)

# name = "iemafzalhassan"
# print("a" in name)
# print("a" not in name)
# print("g" in name)
# --------------------------
# heart = "blackHole"
# print("love" not in heart)
# print("Hole" in heart)

# --------------------------------------

# my_os_instances =["Kali", "Pop! os", "Ubuntu", "Parrot", "Garuda", "Linux mint", "fedora"]
# print("If Pop! os is present in my os instance", "Pop! os" in my_os_instances)
# print("If Cent os is not in my instance", "Cent os" not in my_os_instances)
# print("If Kali is not in my instance", "Kali" not in my_os_instances)



# Bitwise Operators.  ----> & (AND), | (OR), ^ (Xor), ~ (Not), << (zero fill left shift), >> (Signed right shift).



# alculataing volume of a sphare.
# radius = float(input("Enter radius of a sphare: "))
# # calculate volume
# volume = (4/3) * 3.14 * radius ** 3
# print("Volume of a sphare is: ", volume)
