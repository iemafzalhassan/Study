#    A entity of a program that holds a value.

x = 90

# here x :- is variable 90 is the content or the value of the variable.

#            ---> Data types <---

# Type of value which we assign to the variable.


#            ---> Integer <---


x = 95
print(x)
type(x)


#             ---> Float <---

x = 57.90
type(x)

#             ---> String    --- collection of character.

#              ---> lists <---

# lists is there we can assign multiple value or in just simple word collection of value.


x = [14, 67, 9]
type(x)

# To change the value 
x[0]=91

#            --->  Tuple   <---

x = (4, 8, 6)
print(x)
#   output -->  4, 8, 6

#       check the type of x

type(x)
# output -->   tuple


# Difference between Lists and tuple are --->

#       ---> Tuples are immutable.
#       ---> Lists are mutable.


# let's understand it with an example.

            # list
x = [ 16, 21, 23]
x[0]=95
print(x)

#   output will be [ 95 21 23]

            # Tuple
x = (16, 21, 23)
x[2]=90
print(x)

# output will be TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment.
